Introduction
Air pollution is a major public health concern, contributing to an estimated 4 million premature deaths globally each year. Fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) and gaseous pollutants such as NO₂, O₃, and SO₂ are strongly associated with increased rates of respiratory illness and mortality (Science of South Africa, A. of. et al., 2019). Despite these well-documented risks, we could not identify accessible, data-driven tools available to health officials and community leaders to use to understand and respond to the health impacts of air pollution.
This project seeks to address that gap by developing a thorough methodology to forecast and visualize respiratory disease risk at the county level across the United States. By integrating air quality data and CDC asthma prevalence statistics, we created a composite Air Pollution Classifier/Risk Score. This tool powers an interactive D3 dashboard designed to help stakeholders see pollutant impacts and find geographic trends in respiratory health outcomes.
Problem Definition
Despite the dangers of PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃, and SO₂, we could not identify any tools available for local leaders to assess risks within their communities. Community leaders lack tools to assess how environmental and demographic factors affect respiratory illness rates. Our goal is to provide a tool that is able to predict the effects of local air quality on respiratory illness rates. Additionally, our tool will provide “What If” sliders to simulate predicted respiratory illness rate changes if certain actions are taken.
Our core research questions are: 1) Which environmental pollutants are the strongest predictors of respiratory health outcomes across U.S. counties? 2) How do air quality health risks vary spatially? 3) What visualization approaches most effectively communicate complex multi-dimensional risk data to diverse stakeholder audiences?
Literature Survey
Work similar, though not quite the same, to our objective has been done by Hu et al. (2017), who developed a Random Forest model to estimate daily PM2.5 levels across the U.S., and Sacks et al. (2018) whose BenMAP-CE tool linked air quality to health outcomes but remained inaccessible to non-experts. Combined with global health findings from Cohen et al. (2017), these studies show a need for an accessible, location-specific visualization of respiratory risk. Our application aims to provide that visualization adjustable for certain conditions since we did not find any visualization using our accessible and conditional approach.
Vilcins et al. (2024) details the accelerators of and people impacted by air pollution in indoor spaces and how people are in danger, especially children. We used the source through its description of potential aspects to consider when calculating risks of respiratory illness across the U.S, and we looked at U.S. populations to find their predicted trajectory since the paper does not examine the U.S. specifically. Another source focused on tracking air pollution in the Northeastern U.S., especially New York City, due to “North American biomass burning events,” and we used the strategy of tracking pollution in a certain area as an influence for us to track the prevalence of a pollutant per U.S. county (Rogers et al., 2020). We can compare actual outcomes with our predictions through tracking occurrences of respiratory illness in a given area across time and calculating the difference with what was predicted. Roque et al. (2025) finds patterns of air quality monitoring locations and U.S. counties without proper monitoring systems, showing the risk that data may be inaccurate due to no proper recording resources. We anticipated this issue by making a note of locations without data.
Media misreports of air quality can falsely reassure the public, and therefore, increase travel and emissions, which worsens pollution (Zhang et al., 2025). Risks for our map can include amplifying false reassurance, ultimately worsening pollution, but we did our best to ensure accuracy by validating sources and flagging uncertainty, thereby providing greater confidence for our stakeholders. Janjua et al. (2021) reviews individual interventions (masks, route changes, alerts) and finds limited benefits. Birnbaum et al. (2020) finds healthcare costs are underestimated by about 40%, implying larger financial benefits from pollution reduction, especially for people dealing with respiratory and/or cardiovascular issues. The shortcoming is reliance on claims data not fully generalizable (Birnbaum et al., 2020).
Chauhan and Johnston (2003) examine how NO2 increases the risk of Croup and other respiratory diseases. Mann, Wadsworth, and Colley (1992) examine different factors such as childhood exposure to SO2 on later development of chronic respiratory illness. These articles provide information by trying to identify factors beyond air quality that affect respiratory illness rates. On top of that, the paper from Mann, Wadsworth, and Colley (1992) signals that children can potentially benefit from improved air quality. Thiyagarajan and PGDCA (2003) examine how government policies can affect air quality, lung disease, and the people most at risk. Melia et al. (1982) discuss the risk factors other than air quality on respiratory illness. This source benefits our project because it discusses other environmental factors known to affect respiratory illness, which we have accounted for in our classifier.
Gowda et al. (2019) shows PM₂.₅ and NO₂ independently cause lung cancer in non-smokers, identifying pollution as a direct carcinogen and validating pollutant-specific modeling. Liu et al. (2023) links long-term PM₂.₅/NO₂ exposure to lung-cancer risk in older Americans; it provides data and methods for machine-learning-based risk prediction. This research provides baseline methodological frameworks for developing models that can forecast lung cancer risk based on air pollution exposure, and geographic location. Ryu et al. (2024) finds COPD patients highly vulnerable to PM₂.₅/NO₂, quantifies pollution-health dose-response, and guides personalized risk-forecast modeling. For our modeling, this research enables development of personalized risk prediction systems that integrate air quality data with patient health records to forecast pollution-triggered diseases. Robert B. Hamanaka and Gökhan M. Mutlu (2025) provide foundational evidence that chronic exposure to PM₂.₅ and NO₂ severely increases risks of diseases such as asthma, COPD, and lung cancer. It supports our project’s summarizing correlations between air pollution and disease, but it fails to identify future risk predictive modeling and visualization goals for pollutants, mechanisms, and respiratory risk.
Proposed Methods
Utilizing multi-source datasets that detail air quality indicators, and health outcomes, at the county level, we created a predictive model that assesses respiratory health risk and conveys the results through user-friendly visualizations. Our pipeline has four interconnected stages: (1) data ingestion and preprocessing, (2) feature engineering and transformation, (3) predictive modeling, and (4) interactive visualization. The technical architecture leverages Azure Databricks (PySpark) for distributed computing, Scikit-learn for machine learning classifiers, and D3.js for dynamic web-based visualization.
We integrated datasets from multiple publicly available sources to support county-level analysis across the contiguous United States. Geographic identifiers were derived from the 2010 U.S. Census TIGER/Line shapefiles, while air pollution estimates (PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃, SO₂) were sourced from the Center for Air, Climate, & Energy Solutions (CACES). Health and behavioral indicators, including asthma and smoking prevalence, were obtained from CDC PLACES datasets for 2021 and 2020 (to supplement missing New Jersey data). 
Ideally, there would be consistent, daily pollutant measurement data provided from the EPA’s monitoring stations. However, the EPA does not have monitoring stations in every US county, and the monitoring stations that do exist seem to have varying collection frequencies. CACES Random Coefficient Model (RCM) is a strong substitute for this missing data. It provides estimates that CACES claims overcome the main limitations of fixed EPA monitors. EPA monitors can be sparse and unevenly distributed, which may prevent effective capture of local variability. CACES RCM blends this monitor data with satellite observations, meteorology,  land-use information, and spatial modeling to create consistent annual pollutant averages across the U.S. This data aggregation leads to better geographic coverage and reduced bias from EPA monitor placement. While based on a model rather than directly measured, the cross-validated performance of this data is strong.
These sources were cleaned, merged, and standardized to create a unified county-level dataset linking environmental exposures with health outcomes across the contiguous United States. Alaska and Hawaii were excluded, and FIPS code inconsistencies were corrected to ensure reliable geographic alignment. Asthma prevalence was categorized into low, medium, and high tertiles, forming a risk variable used as the y value to train a classifier. We trained a classifier to predict asthma prevalence with different pollutant levels. Our best classifier is a voting classifier that combines a Random Forest classifier with 1,008 trees, a K nearest neighbors classifier with 40 neighbors, and a gradient boosted classifier. Our model achieved both accuracy and F1-scores of approximately 0.68.
The classifier was used to generate predictions with altered pollution levels. The goal of this was to create a tool to visualize how asthma rates would change if we reduced certain pollutants by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%.
To enhance the interactivity of our respiratory illness risk visualization tool, we also created a Policy Simulation Layer that allows users to model the effects of hypothetical interventions on air pollution and health outcomes. This feature transforms our application from a static risk map into a dynamic-decision support system for researchers, policymakers, and advocacy groups. Our intuition is that combining machine learning prediction, real-time policy simulation, and multi-view visualization leads to a fundamentally more powerful analytical tool than these state-of-the-art static dashboards.
The predictions were then loaded onto a map using a GeoJSON interface of the USA, allowing users to easily view asthma risk in different scenarios and identify high risk locations. The interface contains sliders for adjusting pollutant levels. This layer applied adjustments from our model using our scenario-dependent data. The recalculated risk scores are visualized through our existing map-based UI. This innovation addresses key gaps in existing tools like BenMAP-CE from Sacks et al. (2018), which lack accessibility and interactivity for non-expert users. By enabling scenario-based exploration, our simulation layer supports evidence-based decision-making and promotes proactivity on air quality. The Policy Simulation Layer helps users understand current risks and explore how targeted actions could reduce asthma rates.
The proposed visualization system comprises two coordinated views that facilitate exploratory analysis and scenario-based evaluation of asthma prevalence and air-pollution relationships at the county level. The integrated interface combines three principal components: (1) a geospatial choropleth depicting county-level asthma classifications, (2) an interactive control panel enabling multivariable filtering, and (3) a statistical distribution plot quantifying pollutant concentration shifts from possible events affecting them.
The visualization supports user-driven interaction through percentile-based filtering of asthma prevalence, pollutant selection, and specification of reduction percentages for hypothetical scenario modeling. These interactions dynamically update both views—the choropleth displays counties stratified by asthma category (low, medium, or high), while the distribution plot presents observed pollutant concentrations. Coordinated highlighting and synchronized tooltips establish visual linkage between spatial and statistical domains, enabling end users to view the spatial distribution of risk alongside quantitative shifts in pollutant levels.
The percentile-based filter allows users to dynamically threshold counties by asthma prevalence, which reduces visual clutter and directs attention toward elevated-risk regions. The scenario-modeling component supports complementary modes of analysis. In targeted pollutant method, users can select a specific air-quality indicator (PM₂.₅, NO₂, O₃, or SO₂) and apply a reduction percentage (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%) while all other pollutants remain at baseline levels. This method allows assessment of single-intervention efficacy. All methods compute scenario-adjusted distributions in real time, with results rendered alongside baseline distributions for direct comparison and to support rapid exploration of intervention outcomes.
Our approach is better than the available tools we found in our research because of the “What If” scenarios in our visualization, our data integration and the use of a machine learning classifier to predict respiratory illness risk based on air quality. The classifier allows us to predict illness rates in locations where there is bad or insufficient data. It also gives us the opportunity to make predictions on how asthma rates would change if pollutant levels changed. The ability to predict asthma rates from our classifier allows us to visually represent how asthma rates will change as pollutant levels change. This visualization ability is not shared by any tool we came across in our research and also allows policy makers using our tool to visualise how changing pollution levels will affect health outcomes, potentially improving decision-making in the process.
Evaluation
We wanted to evaluate the accuracy of our classifier, how optimal our classifier is, and if we are presenting our predictions in a useful and understandable way.
To find the optimal machine learning classifier we tested numerous classifier methods: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbors, Bagging, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Decision Tree, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. with five-fold cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimation. We ran a 5-fold cross-validation with a 70:30 train:test split for each classifier. We compared the accuracy, F1-Scores, and confusion matrices of the classifier predictions. We then selected the 3 best classifiers and combined them into a voting classifier. Results below in table 1.
We made experiments to optimize the classifier by attempting data resampling and hyperparameter optimization, however, the resampling did not improve accuracy and F1-scores and hyperparameter optimization had a minimal impact. For automated hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search, we used F1-score as the metric to optimize since F1-score takes into account both precision and recall. Our metric of success is whether our best classifier has an F1-score at least 0.1 greater than the performance of a dummy classifier representing random guesses on our data (Bobbit, 2021), and it was sufficiently better than the dummy classifier (0.68-0.34 > 0.1).

	Table 1: Classifier results
An interesting observation about the classifiers with higher F1 scores such as random forest and the voting classifier seemed to primarily do better at predicting the middle asthma risk compared to lower performing classifiers such as SGD. For example, the SGD classifier actually accurately predicted 206 high asthma risk locations whereas the voting classifier only accurately predicted 196 and the random forest only accurately predicted 189, but the SGD only accurately predicted 59 middle asthma risk whereas Random Forest and the voting classifier both accurately predicted over 175 locations middle asthma risk. Further, some classifiers seemed good at predicting a specific class but not as good on the other two. For example, KNN accurately predicted 274 low asthma risk locations, the most of any of the classifiers but struggled to differentiate between the medium and high asthma risk locations.
Another interesting observation is that there are certain locations, like Florida, where the classifier systemically predicts worse asthma rates than real world data. Even in hypothetical cases where pollution is reduced, our classifier still predicts multiple locations in Florida as high asthma rates when in reality there are none at current pollution levels.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the dashboard and “What If” sliders, we conducted a usability testing with 11 participants outside the CSE 6242 course, primarily working professionals. Likert-scale responses showed that most users rated the interface, county-level risk map, and “What If” policy simulations as clear, easy to use, and informative. As shown in Figure 1. responses also indicated that the tool could be useful for real-world decision making scenarios such as policy planning, or choosing where to live. While user feedback mentioned the color-coded county risk map and interactive sliders as great features, there were suggestions for improvements such as clearer zoom controls, brief explanations of pollutants and risk variables, and better numeric feedback when moving the sliders. Overall, the survey supports the usability and relevance of our tool while identifying areas of improvement for it.

Conclusions and Discussion
Our final product is county-level Air Pollution Classifier/Risk Score prediction system  supported by a machine-learning classifier and an interactive geospatial visualization that categorizes counties into low, medium, and high respiratory (asthma) risk. which feeds into our interactive geospatial visualization that categorizes counties by risk levels (Low, Medium, High). This product also includes sliders for simulating how respiratory illness risks would change if certain changes were made to air pollution. With this visualization, people can have greater access to information providing them with a better sense of air quality in their communites. They could use that information to help determine subsequent decisions. Moreover, agencies and organizations can make use of this information to provide better resources to address poor air quality in certain locations.
Some limitations we encountered concerned information access. For instance, our data source, CACES RCM/LUR Data Download (2020), did not have information on air quality within Alaska and Hawaii. So, those two U.S. states do not have any coloration indicating a level of air pollution in our UI. Through this approach, we addressed the concerns of data limitations mentioned in Roque et al. (2025) based on the data we used. Also, there can be future ways to expand this project. First, we can enhance the analytical framework by obtaining more data to better understand the link between pollution in locations around the U.S. and that of U.S. border regions, especially in the north. This potential data increase expands on what Rogers et al. (2020) wrote in their paper, and by implementing distributed lag models to capture the delayed effects of pollution on asthma outcomes,  enriching the feature space with social variables of health (income, education, healthcare access, etc.) and validating predictions against external datasets like CDC, EPA, EHR. We can expand the interactive capabilities by enabling user-defined pollution reduction scenarios—allowing stakeholders to independently adjust individual pollutants (e.g., reduce PM₂.₅ by 40% while reducing NO₂ by 10%)—and deploy the dashboard publicly via lightweight hosting solutions. We can improve visual flexibility by integrating county shapefiles and implementing toggle functionality between point-based and choropleth views, resulting in the accommodation of diverse analytic needs and enhancement of readability.
All team members contributed a similar amount of work.
